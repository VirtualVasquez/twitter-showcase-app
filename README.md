## Summary

This application proved far more difficult that I expected it to be. I had never used ASP.NET in any of its countless iterations before, and I had only recently learned C# when I embarked on this journey. It was quite overwhelming at first, as there are so many approaches that can be taken with ASP.NET Core alone. It proved difficutlt to find documentation that could effectively guide me through the process.

It was quite the humbling lesson working on this project. It took me a little over a month to complete it, and most of that time was working on the server portion of it. The slow-and-steady approach often is the right answer, and it was here. I had to go back to the basics of C# and ASP.NET to gain stable footing and understanding of what I needed to do and how. Utlimately, I've come out of this experience as a better learner and a better software developer.
